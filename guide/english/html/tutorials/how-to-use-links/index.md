## How to Use Links

In HTML you can use the `<a>` or anchor tag to create a link.

HTML links are hyperlinks. You can click on a link and jump to another web address.

When you hover the mouse over a link, the mouse cursor will become a hand icon.

Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.
  
```html
<a href="url">html element</a>
```

Example

```html
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Visit our site for tutorials</a>
```

The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.freecodecamp.org) of the link.

The link text is the visible part (Visit our site for tutorials).

Clicking on the html element in the `<a>` tag will send you to the specified address.
